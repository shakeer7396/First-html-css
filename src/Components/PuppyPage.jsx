              How We GiveAutoimmune diseases, specifically Lupus, disproportionately impact minority
              women. At Beneath Your Mask, we are committed to helping minority women affected with 
              Lupus and other autoimmune diseases with the things that don’t often seem like necessities,
              but may be just as beneficial as medication and doctors’ visits. I contribute a large part 
              of my healing to the health and wellness lifestyle adjustments I made. Often, after insurance
              and medication co-pays, there are often not enough funds for these things. Something as simple
              as help with the grocery bill, supplements, a yoga membership, lymphatic massages, food preparation
              or even a housekeeper can make a world of difference to someone going through what could be the 
              most trying time of their life. In addition, we’ll also donate our full line of products to the
              quarterly chosen recipient.
